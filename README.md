# Roblox Discord Verificatio
This project was created for groups who want there own basic framework of a Roblox to Discord verification system.

I am not apart of Discord, Glitch, or roblox.






# Self Hosting
You can host this project on a number of places, although to create and test this project I used [*Glitch*](https://glitch.com) 
I will only be listing [Glitch](https://glitch.com) for self hosting as [Glitch](https://glitch.com) is free to use for everyone.


## Glitch 

#### Step 1 - Remixing
You can remix the project I already have here
https://glitch.com/edit/#!/roblox-discord-verification

#### Step 2 - Making it private 
After remixing the project I reccomend you lock the project, you can do that by clicking on the project name on the top left and clicking "Make this project private"

#### Step 3 - Custom Key and Discord Token
You're going to want a *custom* custom key, while it may not be much it will at least help prevent people from verifying as random people.

Next you want to get your Discord bot token, I will assume you already have one as you're reading this right now.

#### Step 4 - Getting a copy of the Roblox game 
You will want a copy of the verification game.

#### Step 5 - Setting it up
Open your explorer and in Server Script Service, open the folder "Verification" and then open the script inside that.

Unless you already plan on editing things, please only edit **site** and **customKey**
After you publish your game, head back to the glitch project and edit the gameLink 
Note: site should be the URL of the glitch project
Note: customKey will need to be the same key you set on the [Glitch](https://glitch.com) project

#### Step 6 - Testing
Invite your bot to a server, if you have not done this https://discordapi.com/permissions.html might be of some use, while I did not create the project, I use it to create bot invites with ease. (Credits to abalabahaha)
<br>
Once you invite the bot run the command !verify <username> and test the process.
